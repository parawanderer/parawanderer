Hello there 👋,

I'm a generalist with many interests and end up dabbling in many things. _Sometimes_ those things end up being useful.

At time of writing, having had a good 6.5 years of working in industry, I am mainly looking to explore personal interests and challenge myself. 
As a generalist-by-personal-conviction, I barely have a preference for technologies or languages at this point.

Current areas of interest:
- Quantum Computing (algorithms side of things, but the physics is interesting to learn about too)
- I'd like to learn a bit more about what is currently happening in ML/AI
- Every so often I like to do something more "artsy" using the skills I have
